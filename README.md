# MoodLight
A configurable moodlight which uses an Arduino Nano, Potentiometers, RGB LEDs, and Transistors to create a configurable moodlight.


Hardware was designed and built by myself. 

Used Arduino Nano, Tricolor RGB LEDs, MOSFETS for switching power to the LEDs, and resistors for current regulation.
