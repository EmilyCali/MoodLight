# MoodLight
A configurable moodlight which uses an Arduino Nano, Potentiometers, RGB LEDs, and Transistors to create a configurable moodlight.


Hardware was designed and built by myself. 

Used Arduino Nano, Tricolor RGB LEDs, MOSFETS for switching power to the LEDs, and resistors for current regulation.

Has four modes:
	On: On , but with configurable brightness
	Flash: Flashes with a period of 1s, color is configurable using potentiometers.
	Strobe: Flashes quickly, color also controllable
	Breathe: Goes from dark to bright slowly similar to a breath in and out.
